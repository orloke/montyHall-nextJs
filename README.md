## :barber: The project

The Monty Hall problem can be understood simply as a probability problem. The objective here is not to explain it, if you want to understand about it, I advise you to visit the following page: [Monty Hall Problem](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problema_de_Monty_Hall#:~:text=O%20problema%20de%20Monty%20Hall,exibido%20na%20década%20de%201970.)

This project has two goals:

#### First

Create a simple game so that we could exemplify the problem. This game can be used both for teaching purposes and for mere curiosity.

#### Second

Practice building an application in Next.Js. In this case, my first application!

## :rocket: Technologies Used

- [ReactJS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)
- [Next.Js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Css](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

## :zap: Running the Project

#### Cloning the Project
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:orloke/montyHall-nextJs
$ cd montyHall-nextJs
```

#### Starting the Project
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

The application was built with two pages: the home page and the game page itself. On the home page you can choose the number of ports and the port with the gift.

## :open_book: Code

As this is my first application in Next.Js, the code can be a little confusing, but with some time it is possible to understand what is being done. I tried to divide the responsibility between the files and separate them according to their role in the project. Following good React practices, the page was created through componentization.

## :grinning: Conclusion

The project's objective was achieved: the game is functional and managed to understand the concept of Next. 

I feel ready for the next challenge!
